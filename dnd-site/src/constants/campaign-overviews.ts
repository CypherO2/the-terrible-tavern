  desc: "The gods of Nexoria vanished after orchestrating a war that destroyed the elemental Titans. Their absence caused natural magic to go haywire, and nature-aligned people were scapegoated. Society turned to arcanotech and industry, birthing a new era of innovationâ€”and conflict. The under realms begin seeping into the world, corrupting the weak and opening gates to the dangerous Faewyld. Mechanosia, the largest industrial city, is ground zero for vanishing citizens and gruesome murders.",

  title: "Dark Souls: Age of the Darkless",
  desc: "The Abyss stirs in Oolacile, like it did almost 3 centuries ago, led by the Great Slayer of the Primevil Man. An unlikely party must band together and make a great pilgrimage to the reclaimed Oolacile to slay the new Guardian of the Abyss and preserve the Age of Fire. But this task will not be easy, for the Chosen Undead - in their journey to link the flame - sacrificed many, and killed being of great power, sending the world into chaos. Chaos Demons run rampant and the Land's forces hath been crippled. You awaken in a snowy land of outcasts and castaways that the - so called - Gods abandoned and locked away. A painted world, created by a Medial at the behest of the Great Lord of Sunlight before his passing.",
